<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px">When the character moves toward a waypoint, the system will generate a random distance in yards with the maximum of the property value. When the distance from the waypoint is less than the random value, the system will predicate arrival of the waypoint.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10px">Hint: A large value will lead to early arrival of the waypoint, thus the movement pattern will be randomized. However, the character is also prone to large deviation from the predefined route, thus will get stuck more easily.</p>
