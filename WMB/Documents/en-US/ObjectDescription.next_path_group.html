<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px">A next path group defines a switch for the current path group when the character terminates a path in the current path group. When the character switches over to another path group, it can follow an optional transitioning path that belongs to the current path group to connect to the next one's rendezvous.</p>
