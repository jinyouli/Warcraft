<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px">Path Groups, Paths and Waypoints are the core components of a project in the top-down approach. All of the 3 can have one or more of the system predefined properties applied, aka common properties. A critical feature about them is, when a common property apply to an upper component, such as a path group, it automatically gets inherited to the lower ones (paths and waypoints). Besides, if the inherited property gets "re-defined" in the lower ones, it will be overriden.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px">Such characteristics can bring the benefit that you can fine control all aspects of different actions while the character is moving toward a certain waypoint in a path, with the minimum effort of programming. Take a closer look at the example projects and you will get more understandings about how to use them wisely.</p>
