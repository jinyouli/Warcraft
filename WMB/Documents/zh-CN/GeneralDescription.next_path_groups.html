<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px">A next path group defines a switch for the current path group when the character terminates a path in the current path group. You can add one or more such next path groups to the current path group to build a directional map of path groups.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px">The system checks for all next path groups in the top-down approach and try to pick up the first available one. If the condition checks, the corresponding path group will be switched to.</p>
