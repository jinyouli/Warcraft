<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px">The moment when the character arrives at a dynamic waypoint (the calculated points when navigating between two waypoints) is determined by an "upper" threshold of distance from the waypoint, aka "arrival tolerance for path finding", in yards. When the character moves within the threshold, the waypoint is reached at once.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10px">Hint: By default it is calculated automatically upon the current movement speed. You should rarely need to change this value.</p>
